## Description

Statistical Data Production Ontology is an ontology that aim to represent an integrated statistical metadata, focusing on the statistical data production process. The ontology is built based on the existing metadata standards of [Generic Statistical Information Model (GSIM)](https://unece.github.io/GSIM-2.0/), [Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/GSBPM/Generic+Statistical+Business+Process+Model), [Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organisations (GAMSO)](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/GAMSO/Generic+Activity+Model+for+Statistical+Organizations), and [Common Statistical Production Architecture (CSPA)](https://statswiki.unece.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=112132835). SDPO integrates metadata related to the statistical data production process to provide a comprehensive overview and information on the statistical data production process. In addition to enhancing usersâ€™ trust in the statistical data, integrated statistical metadata will also:

- Facilitate the interoperability of metadata between data production support systems;
- Improve the efficiency of statistical data production through the reuse of existing metadata;
- Enable process automation through metadata-driven approaches, simplify metadata management;
- Serve as the foundation for building statistical meta-data knowledge management.
